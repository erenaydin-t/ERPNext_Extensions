"""Canonical **workflow state machine** and **accounting policy** for Post Dated Cheque.

The DocType stores the current stage in ``workflow_state`` (Link → **Workflow State**).
Desk may offer a superset of actions via ERPNext **Workflow** transitions; **this module**
defines which edges are actually valid per ``cheque_direction`` and what happens on save.

**Target architecture (journal-centric lifecycle)**

* **Journal Entry only** for posting the PDC lifecycle. **Payment Entry is not used** for PDC workflow
  transitions.
* **Receivable:** party-side settlement **only** at **Registered** (Draft → Registered).
* **Payable:** party-side settlement **only** at **Registered** (Draft → Registered); **Issued** is operational only.
* **Cleared:** **only** moves value between **bank** GL and **intermediary / pool** accounts via
  **Journal Entry** — **no party** on those lines.
* **Allocation** of amounts to invoices or advances is **not** owned by this state machine; it lives in
  a separate allocation layer decoupled from workflow edges.

**Transition tables**

* :data:`RECEIVABLE_WORKFLOW_TRANSITIONS` — customer cheques (in hand, sent to bank, bounce, endorsement, …).
* :data:`PAYABLE_WORKFLOW_TRANSITIONS` — own cheques (register, issue, clear, return, …).

**Terminal states** (no change *away* from these except staying put): **Cleared**, **Cancelled**,
**Replaced**. Locked in :func:`is_workflow_transition_allowed`, :func:`get_allowed_next_workflow_states`,
and first in :func:`get_pdc_workflow_transition_validation_error` via :data:`PDC_TERMINAL_WORKFLOW_STATES`.

**Direction-only workflow labels**

Some ``workflow_state`` values only make sense for one direction (e.g. **Bounced** / **Sent to Bank**
for Receivable, **Issued** for Payable). :func:`get_pdc_workflow_transition_validation_error` rejects
invalid combinations even if Workflow UI exposes the action.

**Accounting** (current policy tables vs design intent)

:data:`_RECEIVABLE_ACCOUNTING_DECISIONS` and :data:`_PAYABLE_ACCOUNTING_DECISIONS` map ``(from, to)``
edges to ``journal_entry`` or ``no_document`` only. Missing keys mean “no policy row”;
``post_dated_cheque.get_accounting_action`` treats that as ``no_document``. Receivable **→ Cleared** and
Payable **Issued → Cleared** use **Journal Entry** (bank vs pool; **no party** on clear lines).

**Integration**

Wire :func:`get_pdc_workflow_transition_validation_error` into **Post Dated Cheque** ``validate()``.
For hints without a full Document, use :func:`get_allowed_next_workflow_states` /
:class:`PDCWorkflowTransitionSource` with :func:`get_allowed_transitions`.
