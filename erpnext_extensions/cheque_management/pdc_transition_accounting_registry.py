"""Declarative **PDC transition accounting** metadata (single place for policy, not GL builders).

**Receivable clearing:** **Journal Entry** only — Dr bank GL, Cr cheques in hand / clearing / protested
(see ``pdc_receivable_accounting``). No party on clear (customer is settled only at registration).

**Payable clearing:** **Journal Entry**: Dr notes payable pool, Cr bank GL (no party on clear, no invoice reference — only liability vs bank).

**Payable register (Draft → Registered):** Party/AP lines may carry **Purchase Invoice** ``reference_type`` / ``reference_name`` (from allocations: PI or PR→PI) so ERPNext settles invoices at register; clear JEs do not.

This module records, per edge: document type, whether the **party GL may be touched**, and short
notes. Actual account resolution stays in ``post_dated_cheque.py`` (needs doc + PDC Settings).
