"""Unit tests for the framework-free payroll accrual grouping logic.

These tests import **no Frappe** and run under plain ``pytest``::

    pytest erpnext_extensions/extentionhrms/tests/test_payroll_accrual_grouping.py

The fixtures use fictional accounts/components/departments but reproduce the
data *shapes* the module must handle: a zero-decimal currency, employer-
contribution "expense" earnings, deductions mapped both to liability payables
*and* to expense accounts (a deduction sharing an earning's expense account, and
a penalty expense account), per-employee cost-centre percentage splits, and a
P&L round-off account.
